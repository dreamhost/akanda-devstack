        # where the device_owner attribute starts with the 'compute:' prefix. In our case, when a server is an akanda
        # the device_owner attribute of some of the ports starts with the 'network:' prefix and cause the router boot
        # to fail raising a timeout error.
        # We need to modify the neutron's method that does the filtering and allow notification for the ports with the
        # 'network:' prefix.
